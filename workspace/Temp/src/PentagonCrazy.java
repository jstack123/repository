     // 6. make the tortoise go at maximum speed

     // 9. choose a color that you like for the shape
   
     // 2. make a variable for the number of sides you want (can’t test this one)

     // 3. make a variable for the angle you want the tortoise to turn. Hint: you can divide in Java using “/”.  Can’t test until step 5.
 
     // 5. do everything below 200 times
   
     	// 1. move the tortoise 100 pixels
    
     	// 7. make the tortoise move "i" pixels instead of 100 (don’t need new line of code for this, just change previous one)
   	 
     	// 4. turn the tortoise the amount in your angle variable
    	 
     	// 8. turn the tortoise one more degree
    
 }
 //Variations:
 //  *9. make the pattern really huge
 //  *10. change the color of the pattern
 //  *11. experiment with different shapes
 //  *12. create a method called, "adjustPen()"
 //    	that makes the pen get increasingly bigger.
 //      	stop the pen getting too big (width of 4 or more is too big)
 //  *13. choose 5 colors and change them every time adjustPen() is called
